# MDNS installation

## MAC OS X
You're good to go, everything is already installed!

## Linux
The node-mdns package requires the avahi dns_sd compat library and headers. On most distributions the package name is libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev that obviously depends on your distribution.

	$ [sudo] apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev

That should work on most distributions.

## Windows
